          Founded in 2002, Greenfield International School has steadily grown into a beacon of
          educational excellence. What began as a modest initiative with a handful of students has
          flourished into a vibrant institution known for academic rigor, inclusive culture, and
          innovative teaching methods.
          <br />
          Over the years, we have expanded not just in size but in vision â€” embracing modern
          technology, nurturing creativity, and cultivating values that matter. Our passionate
          educators and supportive staff ensure that every child receives personal attention,
          encouragement, and the tools to succeed.
